# Ad Hoc Analysis (Excel) - Sales Performance Analysis

 
 Objective: Analyze sales performance by country and identify potential factors that contribute to high or low sales figures.
  
Business Problem: The sales team wants to understand how different regions are performing in terms of sales and to identify factors contributing to high or low sales figures.


What does success look like: Data driven recommendations, identify key factors, improve understanding of sales performance, quantifiable metrics.

What trends are important: Sales revenue and order volume by month/year, product line sales performance by state.


### Questions to be answered:

- How do sales figures vary over time, and what trends can be identified?
- What is the relationship between order size (deal size) and sales performance in different regions?
- What product lines contribute most to sales in each region, and are there any regions where specific product lines underperform?
- What factors might be contributing to drops in sales in certain regions or during specific time periods?
